Axi Interface Modification:
I added 2 input registers. One for the root (8 bits) and another for the input (16 bits)
This was done by changing where the reg_data_out mux reads from to read the root/input
for slv_reg0/1 respectively.

Lessons Learned:
Wow, did I make a ton of mistakes on this lab. 
1) For the clock divider, I didn't set the "clr"
input high to start my TB and spent too long looking into other components. Once this was corrected
the component functioned properly in the TB

2) Going through the steps of properly packaging helped me realized I was trying to package a component + source files + block design into
a single IP which caused a lot of dependecies and issues later. Doing these steps individually helped me make changes easier later.

3) I realized a bit later that the XScu_Gic class only needs to be instantiated once. And then we can find the interrupt pin ID (IRQ_F2P[0:0] in this case)
from the xparameters.x file for reference. 

4) Setting the priority for the interrupt to only trigger on rising edge was easier than resetting the "done" pin from the SQRT component
once we read in the value. I would like to remove the need to reset the circuit with "btn3" before each use. But I didn't have time :(

Great lab, lots of learning curves and I feel much better going into lab 3!
